# Web-development-2 (schaatsbingo.nl)
This repository contains the result and product developed for the web-development 2 course assignment (for Inholland University of Applied Sciences) made by Sander Nederstigt.

This assignment involved the individual development of a frontend Javascript/VueJS (NuxtJS) web application, intended as the main part of a simple bingo website entitled: 'Schaatsbingo.nl'.

This application utilizes and refactors quite a number of aspects and elements from the API back-end PHP web application developed (before) for the web-development 1 course.

This application consists of a total of six different pages, each utilizing a number of different components tailored to each part of the website. 

On this website, a user can create an account, login, edit their account information (including the full deletion of their account), request access to premium features, join or create sportsclubs, create and edit the contents of the bingocards and items a user has made, create new bingocards and items, and of course, fill out their bingocards in an attempt to score as many bingo's/points on a card as possible.

The previously realized PHP application covering the back-end (API) for the majority of functionality and actions performed by this second front-end application can be found within another github repository. This application is required and needs to be set up properly in order to run this application with all of the necessary back-end functionality enabled and running.

To run this application, install the dependencies, build the application and start the development server. (see the Nuxt application readme information below)
